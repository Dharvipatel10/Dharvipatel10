## 👩🏻‍🎓 ABOUT ME

I am Dharvi Patel, a passionate software developer currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Automotive Software Engineering at Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany. I have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, embedded systems, and Computer Vision technology, gained through both academic research and industry internships. I am proficient in languages such as JavaScript, Typescript, React.js, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Python, PHP, and C#, and have worked with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, GitHub. My development experience includes building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, implementing backend systems using RESTful APIs, and integrating databases for seamless data management. My projects include a job portal web app with resume upload and user authentication, a movie rating SPA, and a CARLA-based simulation model for detecting autonomous traffic behavior using AI, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques. I have also worked on real-time systems and UI development in the automotive domain. I’m enthusiastic about exploring new technologies, learning continuously, and contributing to impactful software solutions. I enjoy collaborating in diverse teams and take pride in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
